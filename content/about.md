		 <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am currently a senior at Marist College studying Information Technology and Systems. I will be completing my degree in May of 2019. In addition, I am minoring in Computer Science and Cybersecurity at Marist. During my time at school I have earned a GPA of 3.3/4.0 while working part-time and being involved in several clubs on campus. I am currently seeking full-time opportunities in the IT field to apply the skills I have learned and gain further experience in the field. Feel free to check out my resum√© and LinkedIn profile!</p>
