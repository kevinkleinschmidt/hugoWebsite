# About:

  Using Hugo's static website engine, I was able to build my own website pretty easily and quckly. I took this on as a personal project in order to learn a new technology (Hugo) and to have a place in which I could showcase my resum√©. With [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/documentation/), there are dozens of themes to choose from that can give you a simple and clean web design, with room for customization. The theme that I chose is [Hyde-Y](https://themes.gohugo.io/hyde-y/), which is an open source, mobile first theme. After creating my website, I was able to deploy it using Firebase. Here are the major steps I took in building my site:
  
  1. Install Hugo & theme of my choice on local computer
  2. Modify the config.toml file
  3. Create Hugo webpages
  4. Add content to markdown files
  5. Acquire a domain
  6. Deploy my Hugo site via [Firebase](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-firebase/)
